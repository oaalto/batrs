BatMUD Client
=============

This is a very early version of a client that can connect to [BatMUD](https://bat.org). It will be a very opionated as I'm making it for myself and just for fun. There are many other MUD clients that are more suitable for general use. I even have a set of scripts for TinyFugue [here](https://github.com/oaalto/batmud-tf-trigs) that offer a much better experience for now.
